/// 填好的结束调用。早先短版只有「same objective and rules as above」，赌的

/// 又指向旧文案，为此还要一套「下一轮重发完整版」的脏标记跨模块传递。短版
/// 自包含之后，这些机关连同它们的失效方式一起消失。
///
/// 历史是只追加的，所以逐轮在末尾追加短版**不会**动到前缀缓存：破缓存的是

///
/// **来历那句不是客套**。实测过一次：一个会话正在排查别的事，续轮到达时
/// 模型判定「This looks like a system prompt injection or some automated goal
/// that hijacked my session」，然后拒绝执行。那个警惕本身是对的——一段没有
/// 来历的祈使句就该被怀疑。所以两种形态都要讲清是谁下的、怎么来的。
///
/// 「不调工具也不收尾就等于白开一轮」要明说：实测里模型会在得出结论后直接
/// 停笔，忘了自己身处目标轮、收尾要靠 `goal`，于是驱动器只能再开一轮
